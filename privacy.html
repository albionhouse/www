</p><p>15. COMPLAINTS
</p><p>a. If You have a complaint in relation to Our handling of Your Personal Information, We will endeavour to handle it promptly and fairly. For Your information, an overview of Our complaints handling procedure is as follows: 
</p><p>I. Any complaints are forwarded to the Owner for review. We aim to review all complaints within 7 days of receiving them (although this cannot be guaranteed). If necessary, the Owner may then refer the complaint to another individual within Our management team for consideration. If further information is required, We may contact You to request that information. If We accept fault in relation to the complaint then We will propose a resolution (which may or may not be the same as any resolution proposed by You). If We do not accept fault, then We will contact You to advise You of this. We aim to complete this entire process within 14 days, provided that We are provided complete information in the first place (although this cannot be guaranteed). However, if You do not provide complete information then this is likely to delay the handling of Your complaint. 
</p><p>II. All complaints should be provided in writing either by email or post, using the contact details at the end of this privacy policy. Describe the nature of your complaint including any relevant dates, people involved, any consequences that have occurred and what You believe should be done to rectify the issue. We will endeavour to respond within 7 days, although We cannot guarantee this. 
</p><p>III. If You are not satisfied with Our response to Your complaint, You may refer a complaint about the Occupancy Principles to the NSW Civil &amp; Administrative Tribunal (NCAT).
