You acknowledge that you are not a tenant and do not have a residential tenancy agreement nor dominion over the room occupied.<br><br>The boarding house is managed by a property manager as an agent of the proprietor and an after-hours caretaker appointed by the proprietor to ensure the premises are monitored, house rules adhered to and is generally available to respond to any complaints or incidents that may occur.<br><br>Residents are responsible for paying their occupancy fees on time and you must continue paying occupancy fees until the occupancy ends. The Occupancy Agreement sets out the fee required to be paid weekly in advance to the managing agent <em>Travers Gray Real Estate</em> by <em>BPAY</em>, direct debit, card or cheque payments with <em>DEFT Payment Systems</em>&nbsp;(including&nbsp;<em>Australia Post)</em>. Not paying, being behind or if your occupancy fee has not been received by the agent when due means you are in breach of the Occupancy Agreement and management may assume the room is no longer occupied.<br><br>You must pay the occupancy fee on time, abide by the house rules and consider other residents' right to peace and quiet. If the occupancy fee is not paid, the house rules not observed or there is a breach which seriously disturbs the peace and quiet of other residents, the offender may be asked to leave. It is essential you understand that breaching the house rules can be cause to terminate your Occupancy Agreement.&nbsp;<br></p>
